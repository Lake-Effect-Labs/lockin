# Cursor Agent Rules for Lock-In Project

## CRITICAL: Documentation File Policy

**DO NOT create markdown (.md) files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

### Rules:
1. **NEVER create markdown files for:**
   - Implementation summaries
   - Fix documentation
   - Debugging notes
   - Progress reports
   - Checklists (unless user explicitly asks)
   - Analysis documents
   - Any temporary or intermediate documentation

2. **ONLY create markdown files when:**
   - The user explicitly requests a markdown file
   - Creating/updating README.md (which should stay in root)
   - User asks for documentation to be written to a file

3. **Instead of creating markdown files:**
   - Provide summaries and explanations directly in your responses
   - Use code comments for implementation details
   - Update existing documentation files only when necessary
   - All markdown files should go in the `docs/` folder if they must be created

4. **If you must create documentation:**
   - Place it in the `docs/` folder
   - Keep it concise and essential
   - Prefer inline code comments over separate documentation files

### Project Structure:
- All markdown files (except README.md) belong in `docs/` folder
- README.md stays in project root
- Avoid creating temporary or intermediate documentation files

Remember: Code speaks louder than documentation. Focus on writing clean, well-commented code rather than creating separate documentation files.
